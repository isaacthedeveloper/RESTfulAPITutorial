/// The highest level of information returned by the API is a key called `items` that contains an array of all of the menu items in JSON format. Because of this, you will need an intermediary `MenuItems` object that conforms to `Codable` and has a property called `items` so that the JSON data can be decoded properly. You can then access the array of items through this object.

/// The API can also be used to return a list of categories. This list is an array of strings under the key `categories`. Similar to decoding the data that contains menu items, you will need an intermediate object. In this case it will be `Categories` and should have a property called `catefories` of type [String].

/// Yoou also need a model of the value that comes with `preparation_time`. This is returned from the /order endpoint and represents the amount of time until an order is ready. Since the key in JSON uses an underscore, you should create a custom key so your property can be named according to proper swift convention.
